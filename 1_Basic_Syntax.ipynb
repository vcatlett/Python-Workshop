    "## Some Comments on Structure\n",
    "Unlike some languages, you don't need semicolons at the end of every line! However, you do have to pay attention to how you *indent* lines. This will pop up when we start working with functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) will color-code everything in your program. In Jupyter, for example, words which already exist as something in Python will turn green. \n",
    "## Print Statements and Comments\n",
    "Two things to immediately become familiar with are **print statements** and **comments**. They will help you figure out what is happening in your code and make it much easier to read.\n",
    "#### Print Statements\n",
    "```print()``` displays whatever is inside of the parenthesis. You can print multiple things in the same line by separating them with commas. These are very useful to check that everything is working correctly (or to find a problem!). \n",
    "#### Comments\n",
    "Comments are used to annotate code to make it easier to understand. Use a ```#``` sign at the beginning of a line to make a single-line comment, or use two sets of ```\"\"\"``` or ```'''``` to mark the beginning and end of longer comments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Comments *really* help when sharing your code with others, and it helps you when you revisit old code!"

    "## Variables\n",
    "Variables store the values of something so you can reference it later. They are useful when the same value is used so many times in your code that changing each instance by hand would be a pain. To define a variable, simply type\n",
    "```variable_name = variable_value``` (with the actual name and value of the variable). For example, I can create a variable which stores my age:\n",
    "\n",
    "```my_age = 20```\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine I had typed 20 everywhere in my code to do some math involving my age. What happens on my birthday? Well, I'd have to change every 20 to a 21 in my code. That could get tedious, and I could miss some. Instead, if I defined the variable ```my_age```, I would use that everywhere in the code. Then, when I need to change the value, I only have to edit the definition of ```my_age```. \n",
    "### Booleans\n",
    "A **boolean** is either True (1) or False (0). \n",
    "### Integers\n",
    "An **integer** is any whole number *without* a decimal point (... -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 ...).\n",
    "### Floats\n",
    "**Floats** are essentially numbers *with* a decimal point (3.14, 100.0001, etc.). If a whole number has a decimal point (such as 7.), it's considered a float.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can define numbers in scientific notation using ```E``` to represent \"10^\". For example, ```3.00E8``` means 3.00*(10^8).\n",
    "### Strings\n",
    "**Strings** are collections of characters surrounded by single or double quotation marks ('Hello!', \"1234\", \"etc.\"). \n",
    "To include quotation marks or apostrophes *inside* a string, use a ```\\``` in front of them. For example, \"I said \"Let's read Feynman's lectures\"\" can be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "```my_string = \"I said \\\"Let\\'s read Feynman\\'s lectures\\\"\"```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* You do not have to say what type of variable you are defining; Python will know. This is different from many other programming languages."

    "A **dictionary** in Python is a data structure which stores a set of important objects, called **keys**, and their associated **values**. To understand what this means, consider an actual dictionary. It contains words, and each word has associated definitions. In this case, the words themselves are the keys, and the definitions are the values. A Python dictionary consists of a list of ```key:value``` pairs inside of curly braces:\n",
